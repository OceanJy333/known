# Product Overview

**沉淀 (Chen Dian)** is an AI-powered knowledge management and memory consolidation tool designed for information-anxious users.

## Core Concept
The product transforms knowledge processing into three key stages:
1. **Collection → Sedimentation**: Structured note-taking with AI assistance
2. **Recall → Canvas**: Knowledge reorganization through visual canvas interaction  
3. **Processing → Output**: Multi-modal content generation

## Key Features
- **AI-native interactions**: Diff-based editing, contextual chat, smart content analysis
- **Canvas-based workflow**: Visual knowledge mapping with drag-and-drop interactions
- **Multi-dimensional indexing**: Tags, time, content type, fuzzy search instead of folder hierarchies
- **Streaming AI processing**: Real-time content analysis and structured note generation
- **Output nodes**: Generate various content formats (PPT, social media posts, podcasts) by connecting knowledge cards

## Design Philosophy
- **Video editing workflow**: Knowledge library as material library, canvas as timeline
- **Emotional value**: Focus on the satisfaction of organizing and owning structured knowledge
- **Non-intrusive collection**: Automatic processing without disrupting user flow
- **Conversational editing**: AI-powered diff generation for precise content updates

## Target Users
Information-anxious individuals who want knowledge organization without maintenance overhead.
